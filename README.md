Bridging the Hunger Gap:
A Web-Based Platform for Community Food Waste Management

Project Aim
Food waste and food insecurity are two urgent problems impacting many urban communities today. Our project aims to develop and launch an intuitive, user-friendly website that bridges these gaps by directly connecting food donors—including restaurants, households, and markets—with local NGOs and food-insecure populations. Through this platform, we intend to establish a sustainable, efficient system for food recovery and redistribution that benefits both the community and the environment.

Objectives
Over the course of the next six months, we plan to:

Understand User Needs: Conduct comprehensive research to identify the specific needs and pain points of our primary users: donors, NGOs, and beneficiaries.

Build a Robust Platform: Design and develop a fully functional website featuring simple donation forms, efficient scheduling tools for food collection, and transparent tracking of donations.

Drive Adoption: Engage local businesses, households, and NGOs to encourage them to register on and regularly use our platform.

Empower the Community: Provide educational resources to help users reduce food waste and leverage the website’s features effectively.

Measure Impact: Analyze data to evaluate reductions in food waste and improvements in food redistribution efficiency.

Expected Outcomes
Upon completion of this project, we expect to achieve:

A Fully Operational Website: A live platform accessible via mobile devices and desktops within the target urban area.

Strong User Base: At least 50 active registered users, including food donors and NGOs, within six months post-launch.

Significant Food Redistribution: Facilitating the delivery of surplus food to a minimum of 80 food-insecure households every month.

Reduced Food Waste: Achieving at least a 20% measurable decrease in food waste within the project’s geographic focus.

A Scalable Model: Developing a digital platform prototype that can be replicated and adapted for other communities facing similar challenges.

Project Timeline and Activities
Month	Activities
1	Conduct in-depth user research to define essential features and requirements for the website.
2	Create a preliminary website prototype and collect feedback from stakeholders.
3	Develop full website functionality, including donation forms, scheduling, and tracking.
4	Launch beta version; hold community workshops to promote platform adoption.
5	Monitor performance, gather user engagement data, and track food redistribution volumes.
6	Conduct a comprehensive evaluation; prepare a final report and presentation of findings.

Implementation Location
The project will be based in [Target Urban Area], a dynamic neighborhood experiencing significant food waste from restaurants, markets, and households alongside notable food insecurity. Our website will be designed to be highly accessible, optimized for use on both smartphones and computers to serve the community effectively.

Collaborative Approach
We recognize the value of partnerships for success. Our key collaborators will include:

[Local Municipal Authority]: Supporting compliance with food safety standards and assisting in promotional efforts aimed at local businesses.

[Local NGO Name]: Serving as a critical partner to onboard beneficiaries and manage logistics involved in collecting and distributing surplus food.

Regular coordination meetings will foster seamless communication, maximize outreach, and ensure efficient operation of the platform.

Required Resources and Budget
To realize this initiative, we will require the following:

Resource	Description	Estimated Cost
Web Development Essentials	Hosting, domain registration, software frameworks, and related tools.	$1,500
Educational Materials	Design and production of user tutorials, flyers, and training guides.	$400
Community Outreach Support	Stipends for 10 volunteers to conduct outreach and training sessions ($50 each).	$500
Data Analytics Tools	Software subscriptions or tools to monitor platform usage and food redistribution efficiency.	TBD
Promotional Support	Assistance from local authorities/NGOs for social media campaigns and public awareness efforts.	In-kind

Faculty Mentor Approval
This proposal will be submitted to [Designated Faculty Mentor’s Name], [Faculty Title], for expert review and approval prior to the start of the term. We look forward to incorporating their valuable insights to refine our plan and ensure the project’s success.

Thank you for considering our proposal. We are excited about the opportunity to make a meaningful impact in reducing food waste and fighting hunger through technology and community collaboration.
